# Ahmed Mohammed

M.Sc. AI @ JKU Linz | Computer Vision & Anomaly Detection (Diffusion Models)

## What I do

- Build OOD detection pipelines for industrial inspection and reliability
- Evaluate anomaly detection models with robust, reproducible baselines
- Develop computer vision systems for occluded object detection and tracking
